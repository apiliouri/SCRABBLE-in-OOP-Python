# SCRABBLE-in-OOP-Python
The famous board game - Greek Version - IDLE

- This version has 102 letters instaed of 104 (not included the 2 joker)
- Gameplay is Human vs Computer  and the algorithm is the Smart-Fail Scenario. That means, that Computer plays like a clever and adept human player who can find the best words - with maximum score -  but as a human sometimes fails to play the best. One of a custom number of the best words is randomly selected (this number is hardcoded but you can change it, up to your preference 1: the most difficult and as the number increased it becomes easier). So computer has the choice to play between of that number of best words which give the maximum or minimum score (of the best found words). You can find this algorithm in Class Computer as "def smart_fail_algorithm"
- There are no graphics just an idle play.
- This a try of mine OOP python course in AUTH University.
