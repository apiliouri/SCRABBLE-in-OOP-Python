# SCRABBLE-in-OOP-Python
The famous board game - Greek Version - IDLE

- This version has 102 letters instaed of 104 (not included the 2 joker)
- Gameplay is Human vs Computer  and the algorithm is the Smart-Fail Scenario. That means, that Computer plays like a clever and adept human player who can finds the best words - with maximum score -  but as a human sometimes fails to play that. A custom number of the best words (hardcoded but you can change in from 1 up to your preference 1: the most difficult and as the number increased it becomes easier) and one of them is randomly selected. So computer will may play the word with the maximum or minimum score. You can find that in Class Computer as "def smart_fail_algorithm". 
- This a try of mine OOP python course in AUTH University.
